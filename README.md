# BookWordFrequencyGenerator

This program uses a book in the form of a .txt file and counts the number of occurrences of each word. It creates a csv file with the results and also produces a file with all invalid words.
It may be useful for language learning. The books I used were converted to .txt from .epub using Calibre.
The combine program combines 2 csv files into 1.
